A tool for searching Wikipedia articles

Uses the Wikipedia API to show results on user input.

When users types in a word suggestions are shown in a drop down menu that they can choose to initiate a search.

When searching an empty field an API call to a random word generator is made. This word is then used to
search Wikipedia giving the user information on a random word.
